# Power Generator Load Balancing Algorithm

This Python script implements a power generator load shedding algorithm to optimize powere distribution among different generators based on the current load.

## Overview

In many power generation systems, it is essential to balance the load efficiently among multiple generators to ensure reliable and cost-effective power supply. This algorithm addresses this challenge by monitoring the load and dynamically adjusting the power distribution of each generator.

## Features

- Check power produced by each generator and compare combined powergenerated to load.
- Store excess Load to power bank.
-Initiate Load shedding in case power generated is less than required load
- Improves power distribution efficiency and reduces wastage of power .

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/power-generator-load-balancing.git
